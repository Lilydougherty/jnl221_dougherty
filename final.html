			<h3>Simplified FAFSA Fixes Are Already Boosting Completion Rates</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
		<img src="fafsa-1.png" alt="Completing the FAFSA form" width="300">

			<p>After a rocky rollout in last year’s FAFSA cycle, completion rates are on the rise and for once, the tone around financial aid is optimistic. Federal data shows that more high school seniors successfully submitted the Free Application for Federal Student Aid this year compared to the previous cycle, suggesting that improvements to the system are already paying off. Experts say this rebound comes after the so-called “FAFSA fiasco” of the 2024-25 year, when the simplified form was launched but plagued with technical problems and missing features.</p>

			<p>“Last year was the FAFSA fiasco,” college financial aid expert <strong>Mark Kantrowitz</strong> told me in an interview. “When the FAFSA was simplified starting in 2023-24, the implementation went off the rails.” From missing contributor invitations to accounts freezing during Social Security verification, applicants and families faced repeated delays. “But this year,” he said, “the complaints have plummeted drastically.” He credits the shift to the U.S. Department of Education hiring professional management and rolling out fixes throughout the year. For students, the difference is noticeable not only in functionality, but in time.</p>

			<p>Instead of what could have taken weeks, Kantrowitz noted, the application now takes “less than half an hour,” meaning the form itself is no longer the primary barrier it once was. For students who depend on aid to attend college, that improved experience matters. FAFSA completion is one of the strongest predictors of enrollment so when forms are easier, more students apply, and more ultimately enroll.</p>

			<p>State-by-state data shows just how dramatic both the decline and recovery have been:</p>

    <h3>Students are Already Feeling the Difference</h3>
    <p>While national data points to broad improvement, real experiences from students illustrate just how meaningful the changes are. I spoke with <strong>Charlotte Wall</strong>, a Syracuse University senior who has completed the FAFSA multiple times throughout her undergraduate years. She described previous cycles as “stressful and unpredictable,” recalling nights spent digging through documents with her parents only to encounter verification holds or contributor login errors. “It always felt like one tiny mistake could derail everything,” she said.</p>

    <p>But this year, the process took her half the time. “It was smoother... still not fun,” she laughed, “but definitely easier than before.” For students like her, that shift matters. When the barrier to applying is lowered, more students complete the form rather than abandoning it halfway through.</p>

    <p> Her experience reflects broader national patterns. Many states that saw double-digit percentage drops in 2024 show meaningful rebounds in 2025. According to publicly available FAFSA completion data compiled by the National College Attainment Network (NCAN), states like <strong>Vermont, Maryland, and Hawaii</strong> saw some of the strongest recoveries. Others, including <strong>Louisiana and West Virginia,</strong> still remain below pre-simplification completion levels, demonstrating that the recovery is uneven.</p>

    <iframe title="Did FAFSA Simplification Help it Bounce Back? State-by-State Recovery in 2025" aria-label="Choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-ygWZ7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ygWZ7/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="553" data-external="1"></iframe>

    <p>Still, experts caution that recovery alone does not mean the system is fixed. FAFSA completion remains below 2022–23 norms in many states, and the challenges of the previous year may have lingering effects. Kantrowitz notes that many families who struggled with the botched rollout last year may not return easily. “Once trust erodes,” he said, “it’s much harder to convince people the system has truly changed.”</p>

    <p>The data supports that warning. Even states with strong rebounds have not universally returned to pre-simplification levels. And because FAFSA completion is tied closely to enrollment, especially for first-generation and low-income students, uneven recovery could translate into long-term inequities across states.</p>

    <p>Still, the student experience this year is undeniably smoother. “It felt like the system was finally working with me instead of against me,” Charlotte said. That change, small as it may seem, is the foundation of improvement: a system that is functional, predictable, and less intimidating to the students who depend on it.</p>

    <p>Whether the 2025 FAFSA cycle represents a full return to normal remains to be seen. But for now, the trajectory is clear. After a year defined by breakdowns and delays, the FAFSA is finally stabilizing and students are once again moving forward.</p>

			<h3>Why FAFSA Completion Hasn't Fully Recovered</h3>
			<p>Even with broad improvements, FAFSA completion has not returned to pre-simplification levels in every state. Several states that experienced steep declines during the 2024–25 cycle, such as Louisiana, West Virginia, and Alabama, show slower recovery compared to national averages. Experts say this geographic unevenness is tied to existing structural barriers, including school counselor shortages, limited broadband access in rural districts, and families’ lingering distrust after last year’s delays.</p>
			<p>Some states also depend heavily on community outreach programs that were disrupted during the chaotic rollout. Rebuilding those networks takes time. As a result, recovery trends look less like a uniform rebound and more like a patchwork, where progress depends on local capacity, investment in counseling, and awareness campaigns.</p>

			<h3>What This Means for Students Moving Forward </h3>
			<p>Students and counselors say the smoother application process this year has already shifted behavior. More students are filing earlier, avoiding the late-spring bottleneck that left families waiting on aid packages last cycle. Earlier filing also increases access to programs like federal work-study and SEOG grants, which are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
			<p>Experts urge students not to let this momentum fade. “Even though the process is easier, don’t procrastinate,” Kantrowitz said. “The system still rewards students who apply sooner.” With the Department of Education continuing to refine the platform ahead of the 2026–27 cycle, counselors hope this year represents a turning point: one where FAFSA filing becomes predictable rather than panic-inducing.</p>
