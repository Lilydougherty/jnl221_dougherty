		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>My story is focusing on gun violence vistims across America and the states that have the highest percentage of victims. I chose to do this chart because a bar chart shows most explicitly and efficiently the differences in numbers of reported gun violence victims.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="drawnchart.png" alt="bar chart of gun violence victims" height="300px" width="400px">
		

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="firstchart.png" alt="U.S. Gun Violence Victims bar chart" height="300px" width="400px">

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>Maybe change the scale so the box doesn't hit the end of the screen. Very newsworthy and relevant and bar chart makes the most sense in this instance. Maybe don't use 1/4 to present the number. That could be your subline. Highlighting Texas, California, and Illinois could help and make it a blood red. Add a horizontal axis label and add sources and citations. Nothing needs to be added to footnotes. I love the annotations but reiterate the most populous states or highlight the data point.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="Syracuse University has a well-known journalism school" aria-label="map" id="datawrapper-chart-gym6W.png" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6edG6/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="536"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
		</script>

		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>I changed 1/4 to 25% present the number and made it my subline. I Highlighted Texas, California, and Illinois and made it a blood red color. I could not add a horizontal axis label but I did add sources and citations. I also reiterated the most populous states and highlight the data points.</p>
