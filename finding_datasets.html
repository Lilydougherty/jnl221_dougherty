			<p>Public dataset #1
Link: <a chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/rdo/technical-documentation/special-tabulation/CVAP_2019-2023_ACS_documentation_v1.pdf </a> 

<li></li><strong></strong>How is this data organized and collected?</li>

This data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau and is based on the American Community Survey from 2019–2023. It counts only people who are U.S. citizens and are 18 or older. The information is sorted by geography because you can look at it by state, county, congressional district, and even smaller areas.  It also shows numbers by race and ethnicity so you can see what different communities look like. 

<li></li>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</li>

This is newsworthy because it tells us who is actually able to vote. It’s the kind of data that matters during elections, redistricting, or when talking about voting rights. A good audience would be voters, journalists covering politics, community groups, or anyone interested in fair representation or civic participation.

<li></li>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</li>

I think the percentage of Hispanic citizens who are eligible to vote has grown faster in suburban counties than in big cities over the last few years.

			<p> Public dataset #2
Link: <a https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data </a>

How is this data organized and collected?

The LAPD collects this data from their official crime reports. Each row in the dataset represents one crime and includes things like the date and time, type of crime, and the general location. Exact addresses aren’t shown though. The dataset is in a spreadsheet format, so you can sort or filter it by crime type, date, or neighborhood.

Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?

This data is important because it shows crime patterns across Los Angeles. Journalists, local residents, or city officials could use it to understand which neighborhoods are seeing more crime, or how crime trends change over time. It’s also useful for people interested in public safety, community programs, or policing policies.

What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?

Property crimes like theft or burglary have gone up more in suburban areas than in downtown Los Angeles since 2020 and that violent crimes happen more often during the summer months.
